  \section{Introduction}
  \label{sec:introduction}

  Localisation is at the core of numerous localisation-based applications
  (LBAs). While digital solutions for outdoor positioning like GPS are
  wide-spread, similar systems in indoor spaces are rare and not unified in
  their approach. Most current solutions depend on additionally installed
  hardware in the indoor space, which is costly to install and maintain,
  inconvenient in the usage and often raises data privacy concerns. Therefore,
  this projects explores the possibilities of using machine learning (computer
  vision) to build a performant offline indoor positioning system.
